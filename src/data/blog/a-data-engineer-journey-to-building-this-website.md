# The hero story

Everyone likes hero stories. I like hero stories. This is not one of those.

I could argue it was a crazy amount of work to build this website when I literally still don't know what Astro is (it's neat though).

Truth is, as you all already expect, this is one of those vibe code apps where I just did it for the fun of it.

I have been exploring agentic programming a lot lately (yes, that's the cool way to call it). This was pretty much the process.

# How it went

1. I discovered Astro on another guy's personal website.
2. I thought it was cool.
3. I asked Claude Code to build me a website.

That went pretty well. However, the website was as horrible as it can be. Unfortunately I didn't even bother to take a picture of it. But it looked pretty much like a Sphinx doc website:

4. I decided to look for inspiration in other websites.
5. I found [Michael's website](https://mldangelo.com), which I found minimalistic and cool.
6. I used the [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) skill in Claude Code to "get some inspiration" from it.
7. And Voila!

# Conclusion

As easy as it seems. 

It was fun. 

I will likely not turn my professional life into frontend work. But I will definitely keep exploring agentic programming.
